On the Heroku dashboard, we can create a new app. Note that our directory is a monorepo and we want only the `api` directory to be pushed to Heroku. This can be done by using the following command. Note that this also runs the web app as specified in the `Procfile` (also see the logs below).  "

And what about publishing and versioning models that are not included inside a package? Though we have used tox to automate tests, it is not yet clear whether results of models are reproducible in the created virtual environments. Also, how can we move beyond Heroku to other service providers such as AWS? In the next articles, we will systematically improve things and make the app that we've developed here production ready."
