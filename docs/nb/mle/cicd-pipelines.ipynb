    "In this section, we will develop a CI/CD pipeline for our model package and prediction serving API. CI/CD stands for **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment**. This involves automatic testing for changes that are being merged to the main or master branch of the code repository, as well as automatically building and deploying the model package and the associated API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automation means that no person needs to run a script or SSH into a machine every time a change is made to the code base, which can be time consuming and error prone. Moreover, having a CI/CD pipeline means that the system is always in a releasable state so that development teams can quickly react to issues in production. \n",
    "Hence, a project that has a CI/CD pipeline can have faster release cycles with changes to the code deployed on a regular basis, e.g. days instead of months. This reduces the chance of breaking things and makes it easier to integrate our piece of software to the system as changes around the model are also small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, CI/CD platforms can add visibility to the release cycles which can be important when performing audits. For our project, we will be using the [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) platform which has a free tier. And we will upload our model package to [Gemfury](https://gemfury.com/) which is a private package index."

    "In this article, we designed a CI pipeline for our regression model package and prediction service monorepo. We were able to optimize the pipeline so that it minimizes the number of tests. Moreover, the pipeline allows us to build new models and deploy a prediction service that uses the updated model by pushing only a **single commit**. At each step, and for PRs to the main branch, tests are run by the pipeline to ensure code correctness. All of these can all be done without any manual waiting (though, it is best practice to wait for the PRs to complete before merging) and remembering of the specific sequence and checklist of steps to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps would be to include tests in the CI pipeline that monitor changes in model prediction, i.e. comparing new model predictions to old ones when performing model updates. Another improvement would be to build and deploy Docker images instead of packages, and upload these images to some container registry which is then accessed by a consuming application. Note that this is a fairly general procedure that can be adapted to other cloud platforms or service providers such as AWS."
