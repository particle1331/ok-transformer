Finally, we look at how to implement a streaming service, i.e. a machine learning service that listens to a stream of events and reacts to it using AWS Kinesis and AWS Lambda."

Recall that a web service exhibits a 1-1 relationship so that there is explicit connection between user and service. On the other hand, the relationship between producing and consuming services can be 1-many or many-many. There is only implicit connection since we don't know which consumers will react or how many. Streaming services can be scaled to many services or models.\n",

Then services will react on this event, e.g. one consuming service predicts tip and sends a push notification to user asking for the tip. And consuming services which makes better ride duration prediction but takes more time to make a prediction can update the prediction that was initially given to the user by the online web service. "
