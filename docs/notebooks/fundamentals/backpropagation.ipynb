    "In this notebook, we look at **backpropagation** (BP) on **directed acyclic computational graphs** (DAG). Our main result is that a single training step (consisting of both a forward and a backward pass into the network) has a time complexity that is linear in the network size for a single data point. In the last section, we take a closer look at the implementation of `.backward` in PyTorch.\n",

This results in perturbations flowing up to the final loss node (assuming each computation is differentiable). So it's not a mystery that we can compute derivatives of computational graphs which may appear, at first glance, as \"discrete\" objects. Another perspective is that a computational DAG essentially models a a sequence of function compositions which can be easily differentiated using chain rule. However, looking at the network structure allows us to easily code the computation into a computer, exploit modularity, and efficiently compute the flow of derivatives at each layer. This is further discussed below.\n",

As an aside, this improvement in time complexity turns out to be insufficient for pratical uses, and is supplemented with sophisticated hardware for parallel computation (GPUs / TPUs) which can reduce training time by some factor, e.g. from days to hours."
