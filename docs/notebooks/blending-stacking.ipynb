    "Ensembling techniques combine multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms. In other words, instead of getting predictions from a selected single best model, we use multiple models and combine their predictions. This makes sense since different models can be good or bad on different parts of the data. Combining models means that shortcomings of single models get balanced out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the popular modern machine learning algorithms are actually ensemble methods. Bagging and random forests average predictions from many decision trees to reduce prediction variance and become robust to outliers and noise; ultimately leading to greater predictive accuracy. Boosted decision trees are another ensemble approach that slowly learns unique patterns in the data by sequentially combining individual, shallow trees. These two approaches combines similar models that are trained differently. **Stacking**, on the other hand, ensembles a diverse group of **strong learners** that are trained on the same task. In this notebook, we implement stacking along with **blending** which is a particular way of combining predictions. "

    "We define a class that automates training and prediction of stacked models. Several models can be trained on the training set whose predict probabilities can be used as **metafeatures** to train a **metamodel**. This process can be iterated to several more levels. To avoid creating metafeatures that further amplifies overfitting in the training dataset, the metafeatures are generated by out-of-fold (OOF) training and prediction of the models on the features of the previous level. This requires defining cross-validation folds. The **same folds** will be used to generate metafeatures at deeper levels ({cite}`AAAMLP` p. 281).\n",

    "These scores beat the scores for hand-designed ones. Note that the model is not overfitted. This motivates why we take out-of-fold predictions to create meta-features. In fact, the train AUC should be a good approximation of the test AUC. Calculating the train AUC on the entire out-of-fold predictions involves tracking the rows of the confusion matrix that is the sum of the confusion matrices for each fold, over all thresholds. On the other hand, the average AUC scores on CV folds involves tracking each confusion matrix separately to compute the AUC, then averaging the resulting individual AUCs. Thus, train and test AUCs should be similar to cross-validation scores, if error is well-distributed between folds."

    "Notice that training times are linear in the dataset size. Training time with parallel processing has a smaller slope, which makes sense since there are more workers which introduces a constant reduction factor for the training time. I was expecting to see some overhead with parallel (initializing / closing workers and consolidating results from different workers). But from the graph, there seems to be little to none!

    "In this notebook we have implemented a class for model stacking and blending on a text classification task. We saw that stacking uncorrelated models result in some improvement in performance by creating metafeatures which are prediction probabilities of lower level models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main tools constructed in this notebook are the **`StackingClassifierParallel`** and the **`Blender`** classes. These classes expose a `.fit()` and `.predict_proba()` method similar to scikit-learn models, as well as learned attributes `.metafeatures_` and `.coef_` which can be useful for hacking into the models. The parallel implementation resulted in significant reduction in training time, without any undesirable side-effects. The implementation of blending uses the Nelder-Mead method from `scipy.optimize` to find the best blending coefficents for the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallelized model training\n",
    "Parallelism can perhaps be implemented during inference, but this would depend on the exact use case. \n",
    "We got into some trouble with getting reproducible results using `joblib.Parallel`. This is solved by cloning the models in the right places. Also, we had issues making parallel work with XGBoost. But the current configuration seems to work in a Kaggle Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further improvements\n",
    "To further support hacking into the models and metafeatures of the stacker, we can implement a `start_from_level` parameter on the fit function which assumes metafeatures from levels `0, 1, ..., start_from_level-1` has been appended to the `.metafeatures_` attribute, and that the corresponding models have been trained on the respective whole columns, ready for inference. Some rules are needed to make this work, for one, the models dict should include the models to be injected. And that there must be a function to supply the metafeatures so that naming conventions are adhered to &mdash; both are easy. This is nice if we have large models to stack and we don't have the resources to retrain them."
