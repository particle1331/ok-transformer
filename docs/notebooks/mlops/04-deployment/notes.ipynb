Recall that a web service exhibits a 1-1 relationship so that there is explicit connection between user and service. On the other hand, the relationship between producing and consuming services can be 1-many or many-many. There is only implicit connection since we don't know which consumers will react or how many. Streaming services can be scaled to many services or models.\n",

Then, services will react on this event, e.g. one consuming service predicts tip and sends a push notification to user asking for the tip. And consuming services which makes better ride duration prediction but takes more time to make a prediction can update the prediction that was initially given to the user by the online web service. "

A critical element of this is **workflow orchestration** where we regularly pull from a database, make predictions on that data, then write the predictions on a database, or to a file that is uploaded to S3, or it can be pushed to an analytics dashboard thereby refreshing it.
