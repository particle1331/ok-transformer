    "Prefect allows us to programatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. One of the primary goals of Prefect is to minimize time spent on **negative engineering**, i.e. coding against all possible causes of failure. As there are endless ways that elements of a data pipeline can fail, you can potentially spend an endless amount of time on negative engineering. In practical terms, Prefect provides tools such as retries, concurrency, logging, a nice UI, tracking dependencies, a database, caching and serialization, parameterization of scheduled tasks, and more. As we shall see later, this can add observability to every step in the data pipeline."

Consider the following example from the [*Getting Started with Prefect 2.0*](https://www.prefect.io/guide/blog/getting-started-prefect-2/#Makingourflowsbetterwithtasks) blog post. Here, we simulate getting data from an unreliable API, augmenting the fetched data, and writing the resulting data into a database. "
