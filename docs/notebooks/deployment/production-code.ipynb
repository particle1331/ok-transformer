    "In addition to `pytest`, we have the following tooling libraries: `black` for opinionated styling, `flake8` for linting, `mypy` for type-checking, and `isort` for sorting imports. These are tools you should be familiar with by now by using `tox`. Styling makes the code easy to read, which links to maintainability. Automatic type checking reduces the possibility of bugs and mistakes that is more likely with a dynamically typed language such as Python.\n",

Settings for `flake8` can be found in [`tox.ini`](https://github.com/particle1331/model-deployment/tree/heroku/packages/regression_model/tox.ini). Finally, the settings for `pytest`, `black`, and `isort` can be found in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/particle1331/model-deployment/tree/heroku/packages/regression_model/pyproject.toml). This concludes the discussion on production code. On the next notebook, we will look at a FastAPI application that consumes this package as a dependency."
