    "Docker takes virtual environments one step further by isolating the entire application from the rest of the infrastructure of your host machine. Recall that to resolve conflicts with dependencies, we usually create multiple virtual environments for each service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can create separate **containers** for each service using Docker. These services will be isolated from each other. This is nice especially if the application have funny side-effects that can affect other services or the host. Moreover, containers can be run anywhere (any x86 server running a modern Linux kernel) with the same standard behavior. Indeed, we will show how to deploy the prediction serving API in the cloud using AWS Elastic Beanstalk."
