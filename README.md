These are self-contained notebooks on machine learning engineering and operations 
that are generally based on some resource that I study for some topic. The value of these notebooks
is that [they look nice](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and has support for search and easy navigation. More importantly, they run end-to-end with mostly reproducible results. This condition is ensured
prior to deploying the pages.
